### Hi there, I'm Thito Ribeiro and I'm so glad to receive you in my github profileðŸ‘‹
Software development and quality are a passion for me, so I had worked as Tester, QA Analyst and QA Engineer since 2014, but before that, I worked 8 years as Quality Analyst at automotive industry and another almost 4 years as IT analyst.

Although I believe that the fundamentals, principles, methodologies and good practices of software development, quality and agility aligned with the business, products and clients are more important than any specific program language, technology or tool, I am currently working and studying hard to improve my nowlegde and specialize myself each more and more in functional, non-functional and Javascript ecosystem test automations, I'm even taking a chance on some development code, not just test scripts ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤£.
