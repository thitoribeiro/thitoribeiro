### Hi there, I'm Thito Ribeiro and I'm so glad to receive you in my github profileðŸ‘‹
I've been working as a QA Engineer for the past 10 years, specializing in QA processes, manual testing, test automation, and performance testing. Over time, I've developed strong expertise in defining and improving QA workflows, implementing test strategies, and applying best practices to enhance software quality and efficiency.
Since 2019, Iâ€™ve focused more on test automation, designing scalable frameworks, increasing automation coverage, and ensuring efficient test execution, while still handling key QA responsibilities. I also have extensive experience in requirement discovery, defining acceptance criteria, writing test plans, creating detailed test scenarios, executing tests, tracking and reporting issues (bugs and/or enhancements), and generating comprehensive test reports to ensure transparency and alignment across teams.
As a Senior QA Engineer, my role extends beyond test executionâ€”I work to optimize QA processes, drive automation initiatives, and collaborate closely with developers and stakeholders to improve software quality.
During my career, Iâ€™ve worked across companies in various sectors, including investment firms, digital banking, payment services, retail, and manufacturing, adapting QA methodologies to different business and technical environments. Iâ€™ve also worked with a wide range of tools and technologies, including Playwright, Cypress, Postman, K6, Gatling, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, among others.
Beyond my experience, I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead of industry trends. Iâ€™m currently studying a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, exploring how AI-driven testing can enhance automation strategies and improve efficiency in software quality.
