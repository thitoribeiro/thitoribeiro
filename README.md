### Hi there, I'm Thito Ribeiro and I'm so glad to receive you in my github profileðŸ‘‹
Software development and quality are a passion for me, so I had worked as Tester, QA Analyst and QA Engineer since 2014, but before that, I worked 8 years as Quality Analyst in the automotive. Although I believe that the fundamentals, principles, methodologies, and good practices of software development, quality, and agility aligned with the business, products, and clients are more important than any specific program language, technology, or tool, I am currently working and studying hard to improve my knowledge and specialize myself each more and more in functional, non-functional and Javascript ecosystem test automation, I'm even taking a chance on some development code, not just test scriptsðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤£. Ahhh all of this without leaving aside the all-important manual tests.
